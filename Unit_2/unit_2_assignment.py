# EXPLANATION:
# This function accepts a parameter representing the radius of the circle, using the accepted formula of 2Ï€r.
# Rather than calculating the circumference using 2 * 3.14159 * radius, I opted to use NumPy's representation of pi, seeing as it represents rounding
# to 15 decimal places as opposed to 5, and creates more human-readable code. By multiplying 2 by pi by the provided radius, we can calculate the circumference
# of the circle. Rather than using a print statement for the function, I opted to simply return the value calculated. This creates code that is expandable;
# any value calculated by this function can then be easily fed into other features. However, as a result, when calling the function, I am required to use a print statement
# to output the value to the terminal.

# EXPLANATION:
# For this section, I initially set up the visual structure for the output as shown in the sample output provided, including 'Online Store', and labels for Product(s) and Prices,
# using spaces to separate the labels. I created a catalog using a dictionary, containing the product names as keys and their prices as values. 
# Then, using list comprehension, I created an array of the possible product combinations, such as Item 1 + Item 2, Item 2 + Item 3, and Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 3.
# This helps with expandability of the code, requiring less changes to add more products in the future. I then printed the key and value for each item contained in the catalog,
# utilizing spaces to ensure the values fall in the correct place under the label. Using a for loop, I extracted the names of the items contained in each combination as
# defined in the array previously created. I did the same to calculate the sums of the prices contained in each combo. I created an if statement to check if there are 2 unique items
# in the combo, as verified using a set. If there are, I calculated what 10% of the price would be. The same was done for three or more items in the combo, calculating what 25% of the price
# would be. I then calculated the discounted total price, whether it was 0%, 10%, or 25% off. This was then included in print statements containing the combination number, description, and adjusted price.
# Because combinations of 3 or more items require more characters to describe the combination, I created combo_idx  as a variable to track which combination number is being printed at that time,
# increasing its value by 1 after each iteration through the for loop. By doing this, I was able to define combination numbers (ex: Combo 1, Combo 2, Combo 3) in my print statements, 
# and adjust the number of spaces being included in the print statement to ensure visual cleanliness.


# This approach illustrates several key features of Python:
# Dicionary handling; showcasing the ability to easily store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.
# Combinatorics: Using itertools.combinations shows how powerful Python's capabilities are for generating subsets of collections.
    # It also helps dynamically generate all combinations without the need to manually specify then. This helps keep the code flexible.
# List Comprehension: The use of list comprehension helps illustrate Python's capability to write clean and expressive code, creating the list in a single line
    # and efficiently generating all relevant combinations.
# Looping / Data Extraction: The for loop used extracted item names and prices, and illustrates Python's concise syntax for processing collections.
# Mathematical calculations & Conditional logic: The use of conditional logic to apply different discount rates based on the number of unique items in a combination
    # and dynamically calculate the discount and final price dynamically helps illustrate Python's strengths in numerical calculations.
# String Manipulation: String joining as demonstrated in lines 77 and 79, in addition to the use of f-strings illustrate the ability to create user-friendly outputs
    # Additionally, the use of f-strings helps make formatting of financial values with two decimal places easily readable.
# Modularity and Scalability: The ability for discount rates to be easily modified and the catalog to be easily expanded help illustrate Python's adaptability to changing
    # business requirements.
